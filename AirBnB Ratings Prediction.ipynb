      "text/plain": "[\"I ca n't say enough about how wonderful it was to stay here . It was the highlight of our stay in Nashville ! Michele and her husband Collier felt like parents to my sister and I. They were so caring and helpful , giving us the best suggestions about places to eat and hang out in Nashville , and just being such warm , wonderful people that we had as much fun inside the house as we did going around Nashville ! Also , the house was absolutely beautiful , and our room had a giant window looking out onto their backyard , which leads directly into a gorgeous park that we walked through every day . We felt so relaxed and happy there , it felt like home . We did n't want to leave !\",\n \"Michelle and Collier 's home is wonderful ! They are both great people , Michele always nice and friendly on the phone and Collier was very sweet to tell us about the places to be in Nashville at night . With his advice my friend Raquel and I had a wonderful time in Nashville ! Everyone we met in their home was very warm , including their housemate Sally , she was a lovely lady . I would definitely consider staying here again and would recommend anyone who is looking for a nice , comfortable place to stay and looking to meet very kind and genuinely good people to stay here . Thanks for everything =) Greetings from Miami ! < br/>*Rachel\",\n \"I spent night at Michele 's home and felt just wonderful and right at home . It 's a beautiful place , and Michele and her family are all extraordinarily welcoming , open - minded , warm and generous . Would use more and better words to describe them if my English was better ... If you 're looking for a nice place to stay in Nashville and want to meet the nicest people , this is the place to be !\",\n \"Michele and Collier are of the loveliest people it has been our pleasure to meet . The whole family ( and that includes Sally ) welcomed us into their home and we were treated like old friends . I could not recommend this beautiful place any more highly , if there were stars they would get all of them . The suggestions of where to go and what to see were so helpful to a couple of Aussies a long way from home , I would n't think of staying anwhere else in Nashville . We made friends here and ca n't wait to come back , thankyou for everything .\",\n \"We had the most lovely time staying with Michele and Collier . We had just moved to Nashville - house hunting , car hunting , exploring and getting ourselves settled- and we could not have felt more at home ! The house is beautiful , the area is great to explore .... really enjoyed being right near the greenway , such a beautiful area ! Michele and Collier are the most lovely of people . Could not recommend this lovely little home highly enough . My only complaint is that we could n't stay there longer !\",\n \"My wife and I got back from a trip to Nashville and stayed at Michele and Collier 's place . Great accomodations and a great host ( Michele was out of town , so it was just Collier ) . Very friendly and helpful with the lay of the land . Could come and go as we pleased and it is very conveniently located next to Shelby park on the river front which made for a nice morning run . Also very close to downtown Nashville .\",\n \"Michelle and Collier 's home was safe and comfortable . We were welcomed and made to feel at home . The bed was comfortable and large . The room was private and had a great view . The pictures are very representative of the space . < br/ > < br/>This was our experience with AirBnB , and all - in - all , my husband and I felt it was a good . The price was very reasonable for the space , and the neighborhood was convenient to downtown ( almost close enough to walk if you are in good shape ) . < br/ > < br/>Staying in someone 's home is very different than staying in a hotel , but we had plenty of privacy , and all of the conveniences of being in a house . We would definitely stay with them again !\",\n \"We went from michelle and collier 's home to the gaylord 's resort . The contrast was almost too much . I want to go back to michelle 's . is the real Nashville , the other is Disneyland .\",\n \"Staying with Michele and Collier made traveling to Nashville a joy . Michele immediately enveloped me in her warmth , opening spaces for conversation and attending to every traveler 's need . They were flexible and struck the right balance of allowing me privacy and being open and available . Their home beautifully reflects their adventurous spirit , with lovely colors and textures to explore everywhere . The room is large , comfortable , in terrific condition , and with everything I needed . The wooded setting provides lovely walking options . Highly recommended !\",\n 'No Words can really describe just how welcome I felt at Michele and Colliers . Being a time visitor to Nashville they were welcoming and had so much information about the surrounding areas and what to do . I would recommend these guys to anyone wanting a comfortable stay for an incredible price .... Will be back for sure !',\n \"We stayed nights at Michelle and Collier 's beautiful home . They welcomed my wife and I and our children with graciousness and a warm hospitality beyond any of our expectations . These are the kind of hosts with whom you feel right at home and coversation relaxes and rich . Our rooms were very comfortable , spotless and -like the rest of the house - colorful and well furnished . Collier 's breakfast biscuits were alone worth the trip from Maryland ! Downtown Nashville is a short drive away , and their neighborhood quiet and pleasant , with many charming old houses . This was a wonderful experience and a true B&B experience in a big city neighborhood setting . < br/>Mark and Melanie\",\n 'I stayed night for a quick in and out trip . I felt very welcome and comfortable as a single traveler . The towels were great and the breakfast a nice treat . The only thing no light at the bathroom mirror or good light to put on my makeup at night or under clouds . But hey I do it everyday so of course no clown left the house . If the opportunity arises again all the household members made me want to stay again at their great location .',\n \"My husband and I instantly felt like part of the family when we arrived at Michele and Collier 's place . It is a great space and they are welcoming and lovely hosts . Their house is clean , the room we stayed in was large and comfy , and their pets were a highlight for me . Michele gives great recommendations of places to go . Breakfast was nice even though we had plans most mornings we were there to go out to meet friends . We would love to stay here again when we return to Nashville .\",\n 'Staying with Michele and Collier was the highlight of our trip to Tennessee ! They went above and beyond to make their house feel like our home . It was clean , comfortable , quiet - we truly felt sad to leave ! We really appreciated their many great suggestions of things to do / places to eat . < br/ > < br/>Great people , great pets , great house !',\n 'Staying with Michele and Collier was so wonderful that we decided to stay with them again at the end of our trip . Their house really felt like our home .',\n \"Coming back to Michele 's house for the time felt like coming home . Everyone there including the pets really make you feel like part of the family . Beware , you might never want to leave them again !\",\n 'Staying with Collier and Michele was a true joy ! They were so considerate and kind . Their home is absolutely beautiful and I absolutely loved staying there ! I would recommend them to all my friends !',\n \"When you stay with Michele and Collier , expect to never want to leave ! Every morning was relaxing , and every evening when I returned , it felt like coming home . Michele and Collier are beautiful people , and so is the house ! < br/>When staying here , be on the lookout for : extremely friendly cats , homemade bread , Collier - made recycled wine bottles - turned - glasses , enchantingly creaking floorboards , a listening ear(or ) , hidden light switches , an exciting amount of books , and intelligent conversation . < br/>All of these things are contained in a single house , which I 'm pretty sure is magical , because from the street it looks like a little bedroom houselet , but actually goes on forever . < br/>Thank you , Michele and Collier . See you again soon !\",\n \"Great house and great hosts . Big beautiful , clean room with lots of natural daylight , facing a park . Adorable cats and dog . Many good tips on what to do in Nashville ( BTW you must see the Doyle and Debbie country music spoof ) . Delicious home made breakfast . When we return to Nashville , we 'll stay here ! ! :) Thanks Michele and Collier for making us feel at home .\",\n \"This was our time staying at Michele and Collier 's place and overall- another great stay . Great location in East Nashville and is so close to downtown which was convenient for us since we were there for an event . Very homelike feel and they are very friendly . Their pets are fun to have around too !\"]"
